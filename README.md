# Shopping list API

### Requirements
- You need a postgresql database to use the API. I recommend [Supabase](https://supabase.com). Use the ``` schema.slq ``` file in the ``` executable ``` folder to set up your database with the required tables.

### Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the ``` executable ``` directory.
3. Write your database connection parameters into the ``` .env ``` file.
4. Run ``` start.bat ```.  (The server runs on port 8001)
